## 1) Challenge
    Challenge was to create a tic tac toe game in which user will play with a computer.
    And the algorithm should be coded in such a way that user can either lose or tie 
    the game but can never win the game. 
    

## 2) Built with
    The markup language and stylesheets which were used are HTML5 and CSS to create
    the webpage and all the attributes, tags, custom properties used in the project
    are of HTML5 and CSS.Programming language used is JAVA SCRIPT for the functional

## 3)Project
    In the project first a webpage interface is displayed in which there is text of game
    name and directions on how to play. There is one button which is 'reset' . This button
    starts the game from start whenever clicked. There are non responsive blocks created.
    In this nine blocks either O is marked by the human or X is marked by the computer.
    whoever gets their streak of letters in three consecutive blocks in any selected path
    without the interruption of the other player in between wins. After the completion of 
    all blocks if no one wins then it is declared as tie and a pop-up shows to display the 
    result. If anyone wins the game again pop-up shows to declare the winner and upon clicking 
    anywhere game restarts or upon clicking the reset button game restarts.
 
## 4) Technicalities
    Project has a single webpage which has a basic interface for the game which is achieved by
    using the tags, attributes and properties of HTML5 and CSS.Some of the tags are different 
    font-size tags like h1 to h6 etc., imgtags, DOCTYPE, header, footer, buttons, dialogue, 
    different colour properties like color,background-color, position properties like sticky,
    static etc... Many classes, id's, imports, references are also used. Java script is used
    for the functional and interactive part. Many variables were used.Functions were created.
    Arrays were used to dispay the tries of the user in a linear sequence mode. if,else-if,
    for loops are also used. Event listeners and event handlers are used.Alerts are aslo used to
    display the rejection of out of limited range of input.
